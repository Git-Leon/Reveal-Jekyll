Reveal.js Web presentation served with jekyll.
If you have any request, problems please open an [issue](https://github.com/sylhare/Reveal-Jekyll/issues). 
Feel free to implement any change and open through pull requests. ðŸ˜‰

## Set up

Make sure to install bundle which will ease the installation of jekyll:

```bash
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

Run the presentation using:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Create your presentation

### Raw Markdown

Take a look at the [example](https://github.com/sylhare/Reveal-Jekyll/blob/master/index.html),
In `index.html` use the `layout: raw` and then you can create your slides directly in the file using markdown:

 - `___` Makes a basement slide
 - `---` Makes the next slide

### Using Jekyll capabilities

Take a look at the [example slides](https://github.com/sylhare/Reveal-Jekyll/tree/master/_slides) and [basements](https://github.com/sylhare/Reveal-Jekyll/tree/master/_basements),
In `index.html` use the `layout: presentation`. It will use the `_slides` and `_basements` folder to create the presentation.
 
#### Slide

Use the `_slides` folder to create a file per slide in markdown. 

```yaml

---
background: ...                 # Optional to put an image or a color as the background
video: "http://video-link.mp4"  # Optional to put a video as the background
transition: slide               # Optional change the transition type for this slide
---

Slide content in markdown
```

> Don't forget to add the two `---`.

To order the presentation you can do something like `01-First-slide-title.md`, `02-Second-slide-title.md`.

#### Basement slides

Basement slides can be put in the `_basements` folder.
The Basement slides are slides that will be accessible using the down arrow when on a particular slide.

They are the sub sections of your presentation:

```yaml

---
slide: slide-title
---
 
Content of the Basement slide in markdown

```

> Don't forget to use the `slide` attribute to specify under which slide it will fit.

#### Config

Configure Reveal.js in teh `_config.yml`:

```yml
reveal:
  transition: "slide" # none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom
  theme: "black" # beige/blood/league/moon/night/serif/simple/sky/solarized/white
```

You can set globally the transitions and theme of your presentation.

### Export presentation

To export the presentation use `?print-pdf` at the end of the url to be able to save the page as PDF:

```html
<url>:<port>/<base url>/?print-pdf
```

Try it at [.../Reveal-Jekyll/?print-pdf](https://sylhare.github.io/Reveal-Jekyll/?print-pdf)


### Use as a gem

There is a `Dockerfile` available, check it out to see how to use the theme in a Docker.
Basically you need 4 things to make it work as a gem:

- The Gemfile with the [reveal-jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/reveal-jekyll): `gem 'reveal-jekyll', '~> 0.0.2'`
- The `index.html` which is the entrypoint of your jekyll site and presentation (with explained above configuration)
- The `_config.yml` which defines your theme configuration.
- The presentation, assets and content you want to display.

And that's it you'd be good to roll!
